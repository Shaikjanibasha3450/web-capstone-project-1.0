        <h2>Career Summary</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a unique edge: I don't just build how an application works.
            I design how it looks. My journey involves a blend of analytical thinking derived from Data Science and creative problem-solving through web development
            .I specialize in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), allowing me to build dynamic, responsive, and robust web applications from the ground up.
             However, my skills go beyond code. With a strong background in Photoshop, HTML, and CSS, I ensure that every project I touch is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.</p>
